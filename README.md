SNAKE XENZIA

Overview
    
    1. Project Background and Description

SNAKE XENZIA arguably one of the most popular 2D games ever made. In this project we have tried to recreate the prototype for the unarguably classic game. This game basically consists of multiple levels (differentiated on the basis of maze boundaries) amongst which user will have to select one level. It is basically a survival based Arcade game where the snake grows in size eating the food given in the gameplay arena. 

    2. Project Scope

In our project we have tried to limit the scope of the project to the concepts taught in the course (till Object Oriented Programming). But we shall be using many of the functions imported from both PyGame and Tkinter Modules.

    3. Expected Behaviour of the Game

The Snake will be initialized on the display screen at the beginning of the game. The user has to move the snake in the direction of the food in order to achieve more score. More the chunks of food the snake fetches, the user gets more score. To increase the difficulty of the game with each chunk of food the snake gets the length of snake increases by one unit.  However there are cases when the game may end :
    1) If the user rams the snake’s head with its own body it would mean an end of the game
    2) According to the level of the game if the user rams into the boundary of the arena that would also mean an end to the game.
The game is initialized with a Score of ‘0’ points which shall be mentioned on the gameplay arena. With each food the snake fetches the score increases by 1 point.
At the end of the game the user is shown the score that he has achieved in the game. 
    4. User Interaction with the Game

User shall interact the game with the Arrow keys (‘LEFT’, ‘UP’, ‘DOWN’, ‘RIGHT’) on the keyboard and whenever the user wants to pause the game he/she can press the SPACEBAR.
